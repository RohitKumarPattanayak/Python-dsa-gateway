# Python-dsa-gateway

- This a hands-on learning path where i have made sure to record my step-bystep process while learning.
- I have made sure to keep the learning path sequenially to build the Dsa though process right.
- please go through each lesson and proceed as one lesson learning when you would be applyomg to the subsequent it would be better to build the right mindset 



Note : 
1) In .py files i have recorded my initial attempt on the problem statement and if there are any betterment i have recorded each attempt with reasoning.
2) You could also try giving an attempt and checkout my attempts one-by-one making sure you are developping the thought process.
3) I would have uncommented only the best approach make sure to through each attemp in sequence inorder to build thought process.
4) Look for pattern like `attempt-{any number}-start` and `attempt-{any number}-end` to find the previous attempt in a file.
